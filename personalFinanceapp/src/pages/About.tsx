        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          At WealthWeave, we believe that high-quality financial education shouldn't be reserved for the wealthy. 
          Our mission is to provide everyone with the same level of financial knowledge that has traditionally 
          been accessible only to Ultra-High-Net-Worth individuals.

            <h3>The Knowledge Gap</h3>
            <p>
              Ultra High-Net-Worth individuals have access to private wealth managers, family offices, and 
              sophisticated financial strategies. This knowledge gap perpetuates wealth inequality. We're here 
              to bridge that gap.

            <p>
              Understanding personal finance isn't just about growing wealthâ€”it's about making informed decisions, 
              securing your future, and having the freedom to live life on your own terms.

              unbiased, comprehensive education that puts your interests first.
